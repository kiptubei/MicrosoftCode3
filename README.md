This project was part of a Microsoft technical interview for the role of Senior Software Engineer

/**
 *  The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days. e.g 
 * if the given array is {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695}, the *  maximum profit can earned by buying on day 0, selling on day 3.
 *  Again buy on day 4 and sell on day 6. If the given array of prices is sorted in decreasing order,
 * then profit cannot be earned at all.
